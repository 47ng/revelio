## Using Docker

A [Docker image](../Dockerfile) is built and available at [`47ng/revelio`](https://hub.docker.com/47ng/revelio), with the following tags:

- `master` follows the `master` branch on GitHub
- `{tag}` points to tagged releases (eg: `47ng/revelio:0.1.2`)
- `latest` points to the latest tagged release (latest stable version)

Example:

```shell
$ docker run --rm -it 47ng/revelio verify https://example.com
```

## Subcommands

### `generate`

The `generate` subcommand is to be run in a CI server environment.

It will sniff out build context information (URLs to the sources, the build
instance and Git information), and calculate checksum hashes for the built
artifacts to be deployed.

For this reason, `revelio generate` should run in the pre-deployment phase,
after the final artifacts have been built and just before they are deployed.

The command requires a path to the artifacts directory, and a public URL that
will be the base URL for all the artifacts.

### `verify`

The only argument is a URL that contains a public `revelio.json` file.

Revelio will print the build context, revealing links to the sources and
public CI service, then attempt to verify the integrity of the listed
artifacts:

```shell
$ revelio verify https://example.com
ðŸ”Ž  Found https://example.com/.well-known/revelio.json
ðŸ”¨  Build context:

     Build         https://travis-ci.org/acme/example.com/jobs/123456789
